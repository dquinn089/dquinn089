- 👋 Hi, I’m @dquinn089
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Junior Web Developer and beyond, through expanding my knowledge and experience in the field of computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.JS, but still in the novice faze. I would like to explore other languages in the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future projects and applications, and maybe seek help with potential bugs.
- 📫 How to reach me, my email is dquinncontact108@gmail.com
